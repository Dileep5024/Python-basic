        "1.\tWhat is Python, and why is it popular\n",
        "\tPython is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is used for a wide variety of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing. As we know Python, the high-level, versatile programming language, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in popularity over the years. From web development to data science and artificial intelligence, Python has become the go-to language for developers, data scientists, and engineers alike.\n",
        "2.\tWhat is an interpreter in Python.\n",
        "\tAn interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire code into machine language at once before execution, an interpreter processes the code in real-time, directly executing the commands written in Python.\n",
        "3.\tWhat are pre-defined keywords in Python.\n",
        "\tIn Python, keywords are reserved words that have a specific meaning and purpose within the Python programming language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, class names) because they are part of the Python syntax.\n",
        "\tKeywords are part of the language's grammar and are used to define the structure and flow of a Python program.\n",
        "\tList of Python Predefined Keywords\n",
        "\tAs of Python 3.x, the following are the reserved keywords in Python: for example,\n",
        "\tFalse\n",
        "\tNone\n",
        "\tTrue.\n",
        "4.\tCan keywords be used as variable names.\n",
        "\tKeywords are reserved words in the Python language, and they have specific meanings and functions (e.g., if, for, while, class, return). These keywords define the structure and behavior of Python code, so they cannot be redefined or used as identifiers for variables, functions, or class names.\n",
        "5.\tWhat is mutability in Python.\n",
        "Mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object can be changed after it is created. In other words, mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "Mutability Explained:\n",
        "-\tMutable objects: These are objects whose state or value can be changed (modified) after they are created.\n",
        "-\tImmutable objects: These are objects whose state or value cannot be changed once they are created. Any modification results in the creation of a new object.\n",
        "6.\tWhy are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable.\n",
        "The mutability of lists and the immutability of tuples in Python are fundamental design choices made for distinct purposes. Here's why:\n",
        "Lists are Mutable\n",
        "\tUse Case: Lists are designed to be flexible, allowing for frequent modification such as adding, removing, or updating elements.\n",
        "\tImplementation: To support mutability, Python allocates extra space in memory for lists, allowing them to grow or shrink dynamically.\n",
        "\tEfficiency: Lists offer efficient operations for scenarios where the collection is expected to change frequently.\n",
        "7.\tWhat is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python.\n",
        "In Python, the == and is operators are used for comparison, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "== (Equality Operator)\n",
        "\tPurpose: Compares the values of two objects to determine if they are equal.\n",
        "\tBehavior: Checks the content of the objects, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory.\n",
        "\tCommon Use: To check if two variables have the same value.\n",
        "is (Identity Operator)\n",
        "•\tPurpose: Compares the identities of two objects to determine if they are the same object in memory.\n",
        "•\tBehavior: Checks whether two variables reference the exact same object, not just equivalent values.\n",
        "•\tCommon Use: To check object identity, often for singletons like None or when object uniqueness matters.\n",
        "8.\tWhat are logical operators in Python.\n",
        "\tLogical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements or expressions, allowing you to perform logical operations. They are fundamental to decision-making in code, typically within if, while, or similar constructs. Python provides three logical operators: and, or, and not.\n",
        "9.\tWhat is type casting in Python.\n",
        "Python supports two types of type casting:\n",
        "1. Implicit Type Casting\n",
        "\tDescription: Python automatically converts a value from one data type to another without explicit instructions from the programmer.\n",
        "\tWhen It Happens: Typically occurs in operations involving mixed data types, such as integers and floats.\n",
        "2. Explicit Type Casting\n",
        "•\tDescription: The programmer manually converts a value from one data type to another using Python's built-in functions.\n",
        "•\tCommon Functions for Casting:\n",
        "o\tint() – Converts to an integer\n",
        "o\tfloat() – Converts to a float\n",
        "o\tstr() – Converts to a string\n",
        "o\tlist() – Converts to a list.\n",
        "10.\tWhat is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting.\n",
        "Difference Between Implicit and Explicit Type Casting\n",
        "Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another. The main difference between implicit and explicit type casting lies in who initiates the conversion and how it happens.\n",
        "Implicit Type Casting\n",
        "\tDefinition: Performed automatically by Python without user intervention.\n",
        "\tPurpose: Ensures compatibility between different data types during operations.\n",
        "\tWhen It Happens:\n",
        "o\tTypically occurs when performing operations involving mixed data types (e.g., integers and floats).\n",
        "o\tPython implicitly converts the smaller data type to a larger or more general data type to avoid data loss.\n",
        "\tNo Data Loss: Python ensures that no precision or information is lost in the process.\n",
        "Explicit Type Casting\n",
        "•\tDefinition: Performed manually by the programmer using built-in functions such as int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "•\tPurpose: Allows the programmer to control the type conversion, often when automatic conversion isn't sufficient or appropriate.\n",
        "•\tWhen It Happens:\n",
        "o\tUsed when Python cannot convert data types implicitly, or the programmer wants specific control over the conversion.\n",
        "•\tPossible Data Loss: If the conversion involves truncating information, the programmer assumes responsibility for it.\n",
        "11.\tWhat is the purpose of conditional statements in Python.\n",
        "Purpose of Conditional Statements in Python\n",
        "Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is True or False. They allow programs to perform different actions depending on varying inputs or circumstances, enabling dynamic behavior.\n",
        "Key Purposes\n",
        "\tDecision-Making:\n",
        "o\tConditional statements allow the program to choose between multiple paths of execution.\n",
        "Control Flow:\n",
        "•\tThey control the flow of execution, ensuring that certain code runs only under specific conditions.\n",
        "Dynamic Behavior:\n",
        "•\tEnable programs to adapt to user inputs, environment variables, or runtime conditions.\n",
        "Error Prevention:\n",
        "•\tHelp prevent errors by checking conditions before executing operations that might fail.\n",
        "Complex Logic:\n",
        "•\tEnable the implementation of complex decision-making processes using nested or chained conditions.\n",
        "Advantages of Conditional Statements\n",
        "•\tFlexibility: Allow the program to respond to different inputs and situations dynamically.\n",
        "•\tReadability: Provide clear logic for decision-making in the code.\n",
        "•\tEfficiency: Execute only relevant code, reducing unnecessary computations.\n",
        "12.\tHow does the elif statement work.\n",
        "The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if.\" It is used in decision-making structures to add additional conditions after an if statement. It allows you to check multiple conditions one after another. If one condition is true, the corresponding block of code is executed, and the rest of the conditions are ignored.\n",
        "Here’s how it works:\n",
        "\tThe if statement is evaluated first.\n",
        "\tIf the if condition is false, the program checks the next condition in an elif statement.\n",
        "\tIf the elif condition is true, the code block associated with that elif is executed.\n",
        "\tIf none of the conditions are true, the else block (if provided) is executed as a fallback.\n",
        "13.\tWhat is the difference between for and while loops.\n",
        "The primary difference between for and while loops in Python is how they are used and structured. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "For Loop\n",
        "A for loop is used when you know in advance the number of times you need to iterate or when you are iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
        "Characteristics:\n",
        "\tIterates over a sequence or iterable.\n",
        "\tStops automatically when it reaches the end of the sequence.\n",
        "\tCommonly used for situations where the number of iterations is predetermined.\n",
        "While Loop\n",
        "A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition being true.\n",
        "Characteristics:\n",
        "•\tContinues to loop as long as the condition is True.\n",
        "•\tRequires careful handling to avoid infinite loops.\n",
        "•\tCommonly used for scenarios where the iteration depends on a dynamic condition.\n",
        "14.\tDescribe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on a condition being dynamically updated during execution.\n",
        "Scenario: User Input Validation\n",
        "Imagine you are writing a program that asks a user to input a positive number. You want the program to keep asking for input until the user provides a valid positive number. In this case, you don't know in advance how many attempts the user will need, so a while loop is the better choice.\n",
